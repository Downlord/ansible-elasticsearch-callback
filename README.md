# Ansible(V2) Elasticsearch Callback Plugin

It collects the result of ansible task runs and ships it to the elasticsearch.

##How to Use
You can add the plugin into your ansible project where all the playbooks are or in seperate directory of your choice. In any case you need to tell ansible where the callback plugin(s) are located. You can do this by adding following line into your ansible.cfg file.


```
callback_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/callback_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/callback_plugins

```
then activate it by setting:

```
callback_whitelist = elasticsearch

```
